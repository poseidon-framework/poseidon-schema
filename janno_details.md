# The `.janno` file 

This documentation includes some more background about some of the columns in the `.janno` file. This should make it more easy to compile the necessary information for both published and unpublished data.

# Spatial position

The `.janno` file does contain five columns to describe the spatial origin of an individual sample:  `Country`, `Location`, `Site` and finally `Latitude` and `Longitude`. 

The `Country` column should contain a present-day political country name following the `English short name` in [ISO 3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html). 

The `Location` column allows for free form text entry and can contain further, unspecified location information. This might be the name of an administrative or geographic region, or an arbitrary unit of reference like a mountain, lake or city close to the point of discory of the respective sample.
